              <p> Week 1 started with a bang with a lot of verbal being spouted in the gc. With team D absolutely dogwalking team A with a easy 5-0 victory
                the game started out strong initially but team A was no match for team D. The group of somali pirates terrorized the field and left no mercy for the poor brownie boys
                there was however team D, that was a strong blend of ethnic ballers from turkey to bangladesh to even a couple mali's that took it 
                to extra time with them. <br> <br> the qualifier ends with team D having a 3-0 clean sweep against all other teams. But it didnt end without its controversy
                in typcical mali fashion, theyve hired an imposter, a fraud if you will, onto their team. someone from the media degree was playing.
                Unacceptable and so they have been drawn to rematch the second place mathematics team and close rivals. Team D replaced the imposter with Mark from team C who was an excellent goalkeeper in the matches prior
                With all that being said Team D edged past team C in a 3-2 Victory to seal their spot in the championship.
