              <h2 style="text-align: center;">WEEK 1 HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
              <p>Week 1 kicked off with a bang, as the group chat was buzzing with energy. Team D dominated Team A with a commanding 5-0 victory. The match started competitively, but Team A ultimately couldn’t keep up with the relentless pace of Team D. Meanwhile, Team C, a dynamic mix of talented players from Turkey, Bangladesh, and Mali, put up a fight and pushed the game to extra time.<br/><br/>The qualifiers concluded with Team D securing a flawless 3-0 record against all opponents. However, the drama didn’t stop there. In a classic twist, controversy arose when it was discovered that Team C had unknowingly fielded an ineligible player—someone from the media degree had stepped in. As a result, a rematch was called against their close rivals, the mathematics team. With the imposter swapped out for Mark from Team C—who had already showcased his skills as an excellent goalkeeper—Team D edged out a thrilling 3-2 victory to secure their spot in the championship.


                <br><br>
                The next day brought the Engineering qualifiers, featuring five competitive teams. This one was tight, with no clear standout, but Team C ultimately claimed their place in the championship. Their squad, made up of five Mali players and one Bangladeshi baller, added to the growing trend of Mali representation dominating the astro pitches. However, that all changed as the week progressed.


                <br>
                <br>

                Thursday was the most anticipated matchday yet—and it did not disappoint! With a massive eight teams participating, the atmosphere was electric. Accounting students turned up in full force, bringing high energy both on the pitch and in post-match interviews (which you can check out on our TikTok linked below). But at the end of the day, only one team could come out on top.


              </p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">WEEK 2 HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
              <p> Week 2 kicked off with my very own home turf—Computer Science. Now, you might think that as hosts of the tournament, we’d take a step back to ensure complete neutrality, avoid match-fixing allegations, and uphold sporting integrity. But let me tell you something—I wasn’t about to let that stop me. I personally assembled an Avengers-level squad of the finest ballers from second-year Computer Science.The highlight of the day? Us absolutely dismantling Team B with a ruthless 7-0 victory. The lowlight? Losing the final match to Team E… but let’s not talk about that. Congratulations to Team E—do us proud in the championship!
                <br><br>
                The very next day brought the much-anticipated Business qualifiers. We all know Business is where football academy dropouts and almost-pros end up, so expectations were sky-high for some elite-level football. Instead, what we got felt more like a scene from a UFC fight card. Let’s just say they took “standing on business” quite literally. Anyway, the mix of heated clashes and some, let’s say, questionable refereeing decisions (shoutout to Ridwan) made for one of the most chaotic yet entertaining qualifiers so far.
                    <br><br>

                Wrapping up Week 2 were the City Lawyers. A wholesome bunch, really. Only two teams showed up, and while the footballing quality wasn’t quite at the level of other qualifiers, the chemistry among them was refreshing—especially compared to the usual chaos we’d witnessed earlier in the week. Maybe they were afraid of getting sued? Who knows. Either way, the two teams faced off in a best-of-five series, and Team A clinched victory in a nail-biting tiebreaker, finishing 2-2 and sealing the win in the final match. Best of luck to the lawyers in the championship!
                </p>


              </p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">WEEK 3 HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
              <p>
                Week 3 was supposed to feature Arts & Media and Human Sciences… but, well, neither of them showed up. Tough break for the three or four guys who were actually ready to play, but there just weren’t enough numbers to make it happen.
                <br/>
                Human Sciences—maybe next year you’ll have better turnout with the St. George’s med students joining in. As for the Arts students… yeah, that’s a rough one.

              <p> With the qualifiers wrapped up, we’re down to the final contenders—each team with one goal in mind: bringing glory to their degree and proving themselves as the best ballers in the university.

Maths came in riding high on confidence, but with Shoaib out due to illness, they had to make a last-minute adjustment. Enter Hakan, a second-year Turkish student—once a rival battling for a championship spot in the qualifiers, now stepping up as a teammate when it mattered most. You truly love to see it.
