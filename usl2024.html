              <h2 style="text-align: center;">WEEK 1 HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
              <p> Week 1 started with a bang with a lot of verbal being spouted in the gc. With team D absolutely dogwalking team A with a easy 5-0 victory
                the game started out strong initially but team A was no match for team D. The group of somali pirates terrorized the field and left no mercy for the poor brownie boys
                there was however team C, that was a strong blend of ethnic ballers from turkey to bangladesh to even a couple mali's that took it 
                to extra time with them. <br> <br> the qualifier ends with team D having a 3-0 clean sweep against all other teams. But it didnt end without its controversy
                in typcical mali fashion, theyve hired an imposter, a fraud if you will, onto their team. someone from the media degree was playing.
                Unacceptable and so they have been drawn to rematch the second place mathematics team and close rivals. Team D replaced the imposter with Mark from team C who was an excellent goalkeeper in the matches prior
                With all that being said Team D edged past team C in a 3-2 Victory to seal their spot in the championship!

                <br><br>
                The following day we had Engineering, with 5 teams attending for this one. it was close all throughout. no standout team but team C did end 
                up qualifying with a team consisting of 5 Mali's and a bangla baller. there seems to be a trend forming of mali dominance on the astro pitches but that all changes in the next match day.

                <br>
                <br>

                Thursday was the most hyped up day of ball, and it definitely lived up to its hype with a whopping 8 teams participating! we saw a wide assortment of accounting ballers come in and out the astro pitches
                and they defo brought the energy in the post match inverviews you can view on our tiktok linked below ,but one team reigned supreme team A, this time there was only one Mali on the team as it was a mixed bag of turkic, kurdish and pakistani descent that qualified to the championship. you may be wondering why I mention
                race so much but unfortunately I cant be bothered to keep track of all the names that participated, call it lazy. whatever, Team A from accounting goes to the Championship!


              </p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">WEEK 2 HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
              <p> Starting off week 2 is my very own native degree of computer science. Now you may think as hosts of the tournament to eliminate bias of referee, match fixing and sporting integrity,  we'd not participate in the tournament we're entirely involved in organizing. Well let me tell you something. I personally took it upon myself to arrange the avengers squadron of the best ballers
                of second year computer science.Highlight of that day was us battering team B 7-0, We lost the final match against team E. Lets not talk about that.. Congratulations team E tho and rep us well pls.

                <br><br>
                The next match the very next day was the ever anticipated Business, we all know business is where football academy dropouts n rejects reside and so we expected some elite football quality going into this qualifier. Instead,
                 we had almost turned this qualifier round into a round straight out a UFC card, I guess you could say they stood on business, get it? do you get it? anyhow the brawls mixed in with a hilariously bad referee decisions near the end that decided the fate of the qualified team (well done Rodwan).
                its safe to say, business qualifiers was one of the more entertaining qualifiers thus far.
                    <br><br>

                The last degree to top off Week 2 were the City Lawyers, A wholesome bunch they were, Only two teams showed up, the quality of ball wasnt entirely there but the chemistry between the lot of em was a nice change to see instead of the usual shithousery we'd witness in the previous qualifiers.
                idk maybe theyre scared of being litigated or sumn but it was overall a great qualifying round, the two teams played a best of 5 and team A edged it out in the finale in a tiebreaker 2-2. good luck to the lawyers in the championship.
                </p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">WEEK 3 HIGHLIGHTS</h2>
              <p>
                Week 3 was meant to be for Arts & Media and Human Sciences, but yeah… none of them showed up for ball. Tough break for the three or four guys who actually wanted to play, but not enough people pulled through.
                Human Sciences—maybe next year you’ll have better numbers with the St. George’s med students joining in. As for the arts students… yeah, that’s rough. Maybe try studying a real degree next time, lmao.
